# Time Series Transformer

This repository presents a specialized Time Series Transformer, designed to address the unique challenges of time series data analysis. Inspired by the groundbreaking "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al., my work builds upon the contributions of the wider machine learning community.
## Acknowledgment:
I want to extend our sincere gratitude to the original authors, particularly Umar Jamil [https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer], whose open-source code provided the foundation for this project. Their work has been instrumental in tackling the problem of adapting transformers for time series data.  The Time Series Transformer in this repository offers a powerful solution for capturing temporal dependencies within time series data, making it well-suited for various time series tasks, including forecasting and anomaly detection.
